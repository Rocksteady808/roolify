# OAuth and Data Access Fix Summary

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Environment Variable Configuration

**Problem:** Both `/api/auth/install` and `/api/auth/callback` were using `NEXT_PUBLIC_REDIRECT_URI`, which is meant for client-side code and may not load properly in server-side API routes.

**Solution:** Updated both routes to prioritize server-side `REDIRECT_URI` variable:

**Files Modified:**
- `nextjs-app/app/api/auth/install/route.ts` (line 5)
- `nextjs-app/app/api/auth/callback/route.ts` (lines 9-10)

**Change:**
```typescript
// BEFORE
const REDIRECT_URI = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_REDIRECT_URI || "http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback";

// AFTER  
const REDIRECT_URI = process.env.REDIRECT_URI || process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_REDIRECT_URI || "http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback";
const APP_URL = process.env.APP_URL || process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL || "http://localhost:3000";
```

### 2. Environment File Update

**File:** `nextjs-app/.env.local`

**Added:**
```bash
# Server-side OAuth configuration (for API routes)
REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback
APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

These server-side variables will now be prioritized in API routes, ensuring consistent OAuth configuration.

### 3. OAuth Debug Endpoint

**New File:** `nextjs-app/app/api/auth/debug-oauth/route.ts`

**Purpose:** Provides a debug endpoint at `/api/auth/debug-oauth` that shows:
- Install route configuration
- Callback route configuration
- Whether redirect URIs match between the two routes
- Current environment variable values

**Usage:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/auth/debug-oauth | jq '.'
```

**Output confirms:**
- Both routes now use the same redirect URI: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback`
- Environment variables are correctly loaded
- No mismatch between install and callback configurations

### 4. Enhanced Error Logging

**File:** `nextjs-app/app/api/auth/callback/route.ts` (lines 76-81)

**Added:** More detailed error logging that includes:
- Webflow's error response body
- The exact request body being sent
- All request parameters

This will help identify the exact cause of the `invalid_redirect_uri` error.

## Root Cause of Data Access Issues

**Problem:** All sites in Xano (IDs 11, 13) have:
- `webflow_access_token: null`
- `webflow_refresh_token: null`
- `token_expires_at: 0`

**Impact:** Without access tokens, ALL Webflow API calls fail with 404, causing:
- No forms data
- No pages data  
- No activity data
- Complete app dysfunction

**Cause:** OAuth token exchange is failing with `invalid_redirect_uri` error, so `setTokenForSite()` never gets called to store the access tokens.

## Next Steps for Testing

### 1. Server Restart
The server has been restarted with the new configuration. Wait for it to fully start.

### 2. Verify Configuration
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/auth/debug-oauth | jq '.'
```

Should show matching redirect URIs and proper environment variable loading.

### 3. Clear Broken Sites from Xano

The two existing sites (IDs 11, 13) have no tokens and should be removed before testing OAuth again. You can either:
- Delete them manually from Xano dashboard
- Or use the Xano MCP tools to delete them

### 4. Test OAuth Flow

1. Log into your app at `http://localhost:3000/login`
2. Navigate to the install/connect site page
3. Click to install a site
4. Watch the terminal logs for the new detailed error logging
5. Check if OAuth succeeds

### 5. Expected Behavior After Fix

Once OAuth succeeds:
1. Token exchange will complete successfully
2. `setTokenForSite()` will store tokens in Xano:
   - `webflow_access_token` (the actual token)
   - `webflow_refresh_token` (for refreshing expired tokens)
   - `token_expires_at` (expiration timestamp)
3. All Webflow API calls will work (forms, pages, etc.)
4. Dashboard will display data correctly

## Remaining OAuth Issue

Despite the environment variable fix, **the redirect URI is now correctly matched** between both routes. However, if OAuth still fails, the issue might be:

### Possibility 1: Webflow App Configuration

Your Webflow Developer Dashboard might have the redirect URI configured with extra characters, different protocol, or other subtle differences. Double-check that it's EXACTLY:
```
http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback
```

### Possibility 2: Authorization Code Reuse

OAuth authorization codes are single-use and expire quickly (usually within 60 seconds). If you're:
- Refreshing the page after receiving the code
- Clicking back button
- Retrying the same code

The code will be invalid. Each OAuth attempt needs a fresh authorization code.

### Possibility 3: Client ID/Secret Mismatch

The authorization request and token exchange must use the SAME client ID. Verify in Webflow Developer Dashboard that:
- Client ID: `0f2deed02579b7613e8df536899050e17c02ad3a61d2a7bbaf0f80e4a63b596d`
- Client Secret: `21642b8f5d6f8bcbd25743ed8ba9fc957a38f66120bb3fdb352b78522eeb4e51`

Are the correct credentials for your app.

## Files Changed Summary

1. ✅ `nextjs-app/app/api/auth/install/route.ts` - Updated REDIRECT_URI to use server-side env var
2. ✅ `nextjs-app/app/api/auth/callback/route.ts` - Updated REDIRECT_URI and APP_URL, enhanced error logging
3. ✅ `nextjs-app/.env.local` - Added REDIRECT_URI and APP_URL server-side variables
4. ✅ `nextjs-app/app/api/auth/debug-oauth/route.ts` - Created new debug endpoint
5. ✅ Server restarted to load new environment variables

## Status

- ✅ Environment variables properly configured
- ✅ Redirect URIs match between install and callback routes
- ✅ Enhanced error logging in place
- ✅ Debug endpoint available for troubleshooting
- ⏳ Awaiting OAuth test to verify if fix resolves the issue
