# Fixed: Dashboard Refresh Button

## Problem

After cleaning the forms from Xano, the dashboard refresh button wasn't re-syncing forms from Webflow. It was only loading existing forms from Xano (which were now empty).

## Solution

I've updated the dashboard refresh button to call `fetchFormsFromWebflow()` instead of `refreshExistingData()`. This will:

1. **Fetch forms from Webflow API**
2. **Sync them to Xano database** 
3. **Display them in the dashboard**

## What Changed

**Before:**
```javascript
await refreshExistingData(siteId); // Only loads from Xano
```

**After:**
```javascript
await fetchFormsFromWebflow(siteId, true); // Syncs from Webflow to Xano
```

## How to Use

1. **Make sure you're on the correct site** in the dashboard
2. **Click the "Refresh" button** (it now says "Sync forms from Webflow to Xano")
3. **Wait for the sync to complete** - you should see all 4 forms appear
4. **Check rule builder and notifications** - forms should now appear in dropdowns

## Expected Results

After clicking refresh, you should see:
- ✅ HBI International Inquiry Form - HBI International
- ✅ Logo Questionnaire  
- ✅ Contact Form
- ✅ Email Form

All forms will have the correct `site_id` and `html_form_id` from the Webflow API.

## Troubleshooting

If forms still don't appear:

1. **Check browser console** for any error messages
2. **Verify you're on the right site** - the site ID should be `652b10ed79cbf4ed07a349ed`
3. **Check Webflow connection** - make sure OAuth tokens are valid
4. **Try refreshing the page** and clicking the refresh button again

The refresh button now properly syncs from Webflow instead of just loading from Xano!
