# Script Logic Fixes - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Logic Not Working (Hiding Instead of Showing)**
**Problem**: When a condition was met (e.g., "State = CA"), the script was hiding the element instead of showing it.

**Root Cause**: The script was only executing actions when conditions were met, but wasn't reversing actions when conditions were NOT met. This meant:
- Elements started hidden (as designed)
- When condition was met, they would show
- But when condition was no longer met, they stayed visible instead of hiding again

**Solution**: Added logic to reverse actions when conditions are NOT met:
- If action is "show" and condition NOT met → hide the element
- If action is "hide" and condition NOT met → show the element
- If action is "enable" and condition NOT met → disable the element
- If action is "disable" and condition NOT met → enable the element

### 2. **Operator Mismatch**
**Problem**: Rule Builder uses "is equal to" but the script was only checking for "equals", "is", "==", etc.

**Solution**: Added operator normalization that:
- Converts to lowercase
- Replaces spaces with underscores
- Supports all formats: "is equal to", "equals", "is", "==", "===", etc.

### 3. **Action Type Case Sensitivity**
**Problem**: Rule Builder might use "Show" (capitalized) but script was checking for "show" (lowercase).

**Solution**: Added action type normalization to convert all actions to lowercase before processing.

## How It Works Now

### Initial State
1. Script loads on page
2. Detects if in Webflow Designer vs Live Site
3. On Live Site: Hides all target elements initially
4. In Designer: Keeps all elements visible for editing

### Runtime Logic
1. User interacts with form (selects dropdown, checks box, etc.)
2. Script evaluates ALL rules
3. For each rule:
   - Check if condition is met
   - If YES: Execute the action (show/hide/enable/disable)
   - If NO: Execute the REVERSE action
4. Elements smoothly transition with CSS animations

### Example Flow

**Rule**: "When State = CA, Show california-info"

- **Initial**: `california-info` is hidden
- **User selects CA**: Condition met → Show `california-info`
- **User selects NY**: Condition NOT met → Hide `california-info`
- **User selects CA again**: Condition met → Show `california-info`

## Testing

You can test the script at: `http://localhost:3000/test-script.html`

1. Open the page
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Look for "[Roolify]" messages
4. Select different states from dropdown
5. Watch info sections appear/disappear

## Key Features

✅ **Dynamic Show/Hide**: Elements appear/disappear based on form values
✅ **Designer Safe**: Elements stay visible in Webflow designer for editing
✅ **Live Site Ready**: Elements start hidden on published site
✅ **Smooth Transitions**: CSS animations for professional UX
✅ **Automatic Updates**: Script regenerates when you modify rules
✅ **Operator Flexible**: Supports all operator formats
✅ **Case Insensitive**: Handles "Show", "show", "SHOW", etc.

## Deployment

The script automatically regenerates and deploys when you:
- Create a new rule
- Update an existing rule
- Delete a rule

Your live site will always have the latest logic without manual intervention!
