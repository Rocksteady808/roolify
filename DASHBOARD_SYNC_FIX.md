# Fixed: Dashboard Form Sync to Xano

## Problem

The dashboard refresh button was:
1. ‚úÖ Fetching forms from Webflow API
2. ‚úÖ Displaying them in the dashboard
3. ‚ùå **NOT syncing them to Xano database**

This caused forms to appear in the dashboard but **not in rule builder or notifications** because those pages query the Xano database.

## Root Cause

The `fetchFormsFromWebflow()` function was only fetching and displaying forms, but not saving them to the Xano database. The rule builder and notifications pages use `/api/forms/xano` which queries the Xano database, not the Webflow API.

## Solution

I've updated the dashboard to **sync forms to Xano** after fetching them from Webflow:

### What Changed

**Before:**
```javascript
// Only fetch and display forms
setForms(items);
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Fetch and display forms
setForms(items);

// SYNC FORMS TO XANO DATABASE
for (const form of items) {
  await fetch('/api/forms/xano', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({
      name: form.name,
      siteId: siteId,
      htmlFormId: form.id,
      formFields: form.fields
    })
  });
}
```

### How It Works

1. **Fetch forms from Webflow API** (as before)
2. **Display forms in dashboard** (as before)
3. **üÜï Sync each form to Xano database** (NEW)
4. **Forms now appear in rule builder and notifications** (FIXED)

## Expected Results

After clicking the refresh button:

1. **Dashboard**: Shows all 4 forms ‚úÖ
2. **Rule Builder**: All forms appear in "Target Form" dropdown ‚úÖ
3. **Notifications**: All forms appear in "Target Form" dropdown ‚úÖ

## Testing Steps

1. **Go to dashboard**
2. **Click "Refresh" button**
3. **Wait for sync to complete** (check browser console for sync logs)
4. **Navigate to Rule Builder** - forms should be in dropdown
5. **Navigate to Notifications** - forms should be in dropdown

## Console Logs

You should see logs like:
```
[Dashboard] üîÑ Syncing forms to Xano database...
[Dashboard] Syncing form: HBI International Inquiry Form (68f648d669c38f6206830743)
[Dashboard] ‚úÖ Synced form "HBI International Inquiry Form" to Xano with ID: 123
[Dashboard] ‚úÖ All forms synced to Xano database
```

## Why This Fixes the Issue

- **Dashboard**: Shows forms from Webflow API ‚úÖ
- **Rule Builder**: Queries `/api/forms/xano` which now has the synced forms ‚úÖ
- **Notifications**: Queries `/api/forms/xano` which now has the synced forms ‚úÖ

All pages now have access to the same form data because they're all synced to the Xano database!
