# Netlify 404 Error Fix for Roolify

## The Problem
You're getting a "Page not found" error because Netlify is trying to serve your Next.js app as a static site, but your app has API routes that need server-side functionality.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Static Export (Recommended for MVP)
This converts your app to a static site, but API routes won't work. You'll need to handle API calls differently.

**Steps:**
1. The configuration is already updated in `netlify.toml` and `next.config.mjs`
2. Redeploy to Netlify
3. Your app will work as a static site

**Limitations:**
- API routes won't work (no server-side functionality)
- Form submissions will need to be handled differently
- Webhooks won't work

### Option 2: Netlify Functions (Full Functionality)
This keeps your API routes working by converting them to Netlify Functions.

**Steps:**
1. Install Netlify CLI: `npm install -g netlify-cli`
2. Create a `netlify/functions` directory
3. Convert your API routes to Netlify Functions
4. Update the build configuration

### Option 3: Vercel Deployment (Recommended)
Vercel is designed for Next.js apps and handles API routes natively.

**Steps:**
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Deploy automatically
4. All API routes will work perfectly

## Quick Fix for Current Deployment

### For Static Site (Immediate Fix):
1. **Redeploy** your site on Netlify
2. The updated configuration will create a static export
3. Your app will load, but API routes won't work

### For Full Functionality:
1. **Switch to Vercel** for better Next.js support
2. Or implement Netlify Functions for API routes

## Environment Variables for Netlify

Make sure these are set in your Netlify dashboard:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_XANO_API_URL=https://x1zj-piqu-kkh1.n7e.xano.io/api:sb2RCLwj
NEXT_PUBLIC_XANO_PUBLIC_KEY=your_xano_public_key
XANO_API_KEY=your_xano_api_key
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key
WEBFLOW_CLIENT_ID=your_webflow_client_id_here
WEBFLOW_CLIENT_SECRET=your_webflow_client_secret_here
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_stripe_publishable_key
```

## Testing Your Deployment

1. **Check the build logs** in Netlify dashboard
2. **Verify environment variables** are set correctly
3. **Test the main page** loads without 404
4. **Test API routes** (if using Netlify Functions)

## Next Steps

1. **Redeploy** with the updated configuration
2. **Test** that the main page loads
3. **Consider Vercel** for full API functionality
4. **Update OAuth redirects** to your new domain
