## üîß Next Steps for Full Implementation

### 1. Xano Setup (Required)

Follow `XANO_PLANS_SCHEMA.md` to:

1. **Update plan table** with pricing fields:
   - `max_forms`, `max_logic_rules`, `max_submissions`
   - `price_monthly`, `price_annual`

2. **Insert plan data** for all three tiers

3. **Update user table** with:
   - `plan_id` (foreign key)
   - `billing_cycle` ('monthly' or 'annual')
   - `subscription_status`
   - `trial_ends_at`

4. **Create usage tracking** (optional but recommended)

5. **Update `/auth/me` endpoint** to include plan data

### 2. API Endpoints (To Be Created)

#### `GET /api/user/plan`
Returns user's current plan and usage

#### `GET /api/user/usage`
Returns current usage statistics:
```json
{
  "forms_count": 3,
  "rules_count": 12,
  "submissions_count": 1247,
  "limits": {
    "max_forms": 5,
    "max_logic_rules": 10,
    "max_submissions": 10000
  }
}
```

#### `POST /api/user/plan`
Updates user's plan selection

### 3. Limit Enforcement (To Be Added)

Add checks when users:
- **Create new forms**: Check against `max_forms`
- **Add logic rules**: Check against `max_logic_rules` per form
- **Receive submissions**: Check against `max_submissions` per month

Display warnings:
- At 75% usage: Yellow alert
- At 90% usage: Red alert with upgrade prompt
- At 100% usage: Block action, require upgrade

### 4. Stripe Integration (Future)

- Stripe Checkout for payment processing
- Webhook handling for subscription events
- Automatic plan activation/cancellation
- Proration for plan changes
- Invoice generation

### 5. Dashboard Integration (Recommended)

Add `UsageStats` component to dashboard:

```tsx
import UsageStats from '@/components/UsageStats';

// In dashboard
<UsageStats />
```

## üìù Usage Component Integration

To add usage stats to any page:

```tsx
import UsageStats from '@/components/UsageStats';

export default function MyPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Your page content */}
      
      {/* Usage stats in sidebar or main content */}
      <UsageStats />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## üé® Design Consistency

All new components follow your app's design system:
- **Colors**: Indigo primary, gray neutrals, green/yellow/red for status
- **Typography**: Consistent font sizes and weights
- **Spacing**: 4px/8px grid system
- **Border radius**: Rounded corners (8px standard)
- **Shadows**: Subtle shadows for elevation
- **Icons**: Heroicons for consistency
