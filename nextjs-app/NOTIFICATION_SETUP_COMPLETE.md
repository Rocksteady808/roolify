# Notification System - Complete Setup Guide

## System Overview

Your notification system is **fully configured and ready to use!** Here's how it works:

### Architecture

```
User submits form
    ‚Üì
Webflow sends data to webhook
    ‚Üì
Webhook saves to Xano
    ‚Üì
Webhook loads notification settings (from notifications.json)
    ‚Üì
Evaluates routing rules
    ‚Üì
Sends emails via Xano SendGrid API
    ‚Üì
Recipient receives beautiful HTML email
```

---

## What's Already Set Up

### ‚úÖ 1. **File-Based Storage** (`notifications.json`)
- Notification settings are stored locally in `notifications.json`
- Same approach as your conditional logic rules
- No Xano dependency for storing notification settings
- Settings survive server restarts

### ‚úÖ 2. **SendGrid Integration** (via Xano)
- Connected to: `https://x8ki-letl-twmt.n7.xano.io/api:lDK9yEIt/sendgrid/validate`
- Sends HTML emails with form data
- Beautiful email templates with gradient header
- Automatic formatting of form fields

### ‚úÖ 3. **Notification Settings UI** (`/notifications` page)
- Select a form from dropdown
- Configure admin routing rules (send to different people based on form values)
- Configure user confirmation emails (optional)
- Set fallback emails if no routes match
- Save settings per form

### ‚úÖ 4. **Webhook Processing** (`/api/submissions/webhook`)
- Receives form submissions
- Saves to Xano
- Loads notification settings for that specific form
- Evaluates routing conditions
- Sends emails to matching recipients
- Uses fallback email if no routes match

## How to Use It

### Step 1: Configure Notification Settings

1. **Go to**: `http://localhost:1337/notifications`
2. **Select a form** from the dropdown
3. **Add Admin Routing Rules**:
   - **Field**: The form field to check (e.g., "Select a Country")
   - **Operator**: How to match (equals, contains, starts with, ends with)
   - **Value**: The value to match (e.g., "United Kingdom")
   - **Recipients**: Email addresses to send to (comma-separated)

4. **Add Fallback Email** (optional but recommended):
   - This email receives notifications when no routing rules match
   - Example: `admin@yourdomain.com`

5. **Click "Save Settings"**

### Step 2: Test It

1. **Go to your published Webflow site**: `https://flow-forms-f8b3f7.webflow.io/`
2. **Fill out and submit a form**
3. **Watch the terminal logs** - you'll see:
   ```
   [Submission Webhook] ‚úÖ Received submission
   [Email] Processing notification settings
   [Email] Admin route matched - Field: Select a Country Value: United Kingdom
   [Email] Sending email to: your-email@example.com
   [Email] Email sent successfully
   ```
4. **Check your inbox** - you'll receive a beautiful HTML email with the form data!

## Notification Settings Structure

### File Location
`nextjs-app/notifications.json`

### Example Settings

```json
[
  {
    "id": "notif_1736668800000_abc123",
    "formId": "wf-form-Country-Form",
    "siteId": "68bc42f58e22a62ce5c282e0",
    "formName": "Country Form",
    "adminRoutes": [
      {
        "id": "route_1",
        "field": "Select a Country",
        "operator": "equals",
        "value": "United Kingdom",
        "recipients": "uk-team@example.com"
      },
      {
        "id": "route_2",
        "field": "Select a Country",
        "operator": "equals",
        "value": "United States",
        "recipients": "us-team@example.com"
      }
    ],
    "userRoutes": [],
    "adminFallbackEmail": "admin@example.com",
    "userFallbackEmail": null,
    "createdAt": "2025-01-12T04:00:00.000Z",
    "updatedAt": "2025-01-12T04:00:00.000Z"
  }
]
```

## Routing Rules Explained

### Available Operators

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `equals` | Exact match (case-insensitive) | Field = "California" matches "california" or "CALIFORNIA" |
| `contains` | Value contains substring | Field contains "tech" matches "Technology" or "Fintech" |
| `starts_with` | Value starts with | Field starts with "Mr" matches "Mr. Smith" |
| `ends_with` | Value ends with | Field ends with ".com" matches "example.com" |

### How Routing Works

1. **Form is submitted**
2. **System checks each route in order**
3. **For each route**:
   - Check if the field value matches the condition
   - If it matches, add recipients to the email list
4. **Send emails to all matching recipients**
5. **If no routes matched**, use fallback email (if configured)

## Email Templates

### Admin Notification Email

**Subject**: `New submission from {Form Name}`

**Content**:
- Purple gradient header
- "New Form Submission" title
- All form fields in a formatted table
- Clean, professional design

### User Confirmation Email

**Subject**: `Thank you for your submission`

**Content**:
- Purple gradient header
- "Submission Received" title
- Copy of submitted data
- Thank you message

## Troubleshooting

### Emails Not Sending?

**Check the terminal logs**:

```bash
# Good sign - Settings loaded
[Email] Processing notification settings

# Good sign - Route matched
[Email] Admin route matched - Field: Select a Country Value: United Kingdom

# Good sign - Email sent
[Email] Email sent successfully

# Problem - No settings found
[Email] No notification settings configured for form: wf-form-Country-Form
‚Üí Solution: Go to /notifications and configure settings for this form

# Problem - SendGrid API error
[Email] SendGrid API error: 500 Internal Server Error
‚Üí Solution: Check your SendGrid API key in Xano environment variables
```

### How to Check SendGrid Configuration in Xano

1. **Go to Xano**: https://xano.io
2. **Open your workspace**
3. **Click "Environment Variables"** (top-right gear icon)
4. **Check**:
   - `SENDGRID_API_KEY` - Your SendGrid API key
   - `sendgrid_from_email` - Your verified sender email (e.g., `noreply@yourdomain.com`)
5. **Make sure both are set correctly**
6. **Click "Save"**

---

## Advanced: Multiple Recipients

You can send to multiple people by adding **comma-separated emails**:

```
recipient1@example.com, recipient2@example.com, recipient3@example.com
```

**Example**:
- **Field**: "Department"
- **Operator**: "equals"
- **Value**: "Sales"
- **Recipients**: `sales-manager@example.com, sales-team@example.com, ceo@example.com`

## What IS Using Xano

- ‚úÖ SendGrid email sending
- ‚úÖ Form submissions storage
- ‚úÖ User authentication
- ‚úÖ Plans & billing

## Next Steps

1. **Test the system**:

   - Configure settings for your "Country Form"
   - Submit a test form
   - Check your email

2. **Configure all your forms**:
   - Add notification settings for each form
   - Set up routing rules based on your needs
   - Always add a fallback email as a safety net
