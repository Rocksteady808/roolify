# Validation Fix for Conditional Logic

## ✅ Update Applied

Your existing unified script (`/api/script/unified/[siteId]`) now automatically handles the `required` attribute for fields controlled by conditional logic.

## What Changed

**Before:**
- Hidden fields kept their `required` attribute
- Form submission failed validation on hidden required fields
- Users couldn't submit forms when conditional logic hid required fields

**After:**
- When a field is hidden, its `required` attribute is automatically removed
- When a field is shown, its `required` attribute is automatically restored
- Forms submit successfully regardless of conditional logic state

## How It Works

The script now:

1. **When hiding a field** (either `show` or `hide` action):
   - Stores the original `required` state in `data-roolify-was-required` attribute
   - Removes the `required` attribute
   - Field no longer blocks form submission

2. **When showing a field**:
   - Checks if field was originally required
   - Restores the `required` attribute
   - Field validation works normally

## No Action Required

✅ The fix is **built into your existing unified script**  
✅ **No additional scripts needed**  
✅ Works automatically for all sites  
✅ Applies to all forms with conditional logic  

## Testing

To verify the fix is working:

1. Visit any form with conditional logic
2. Trigger logic that hides a required field
3. Try to submit the form
4. ✅ Form should submit successfully (hidden fields don't block submission)
5. Show the field again
6. Try to submit without filling it
7. ✅ Validation should work (visible required fields are validated)

## Example

**Scenario: Business Type Form**

Fields:
- Business Type (Select): "Individual" / "Company"
- Company Name (Text, Required)

Conditional Logic:
- Show "Company Name" only if "Company" is selected

**User Actions:**
1. User selects "Individual"
   - Script hides "Company Name" field
   - Script removes `required` attribute
   - `data-roolify-was-required="true"` is set

2. User clicks Submit
   - Webflow validates only visible fields
   - ✅ Form submits successfully

3. User selects "Company"
   - Script shows "Company Name" field
   - Script restores `required` attribute
   - `data-roolify-was-required` is removed

4. User clicks Submit without filling "Company Name"
   - Webflow validates "Company Name" is required
   - ❌ Validation fails (as expected)

## Browser Compatibility

✅ Works in all modern browsers:
- Chrome/Edge
- Firefox
- Safari
- Mobile browsers

## Debug

If you encounter issues, check the browser console for:
```
[Roolify] Executing rule: [rule name]
```

The unified script logs all conditional logic actions, including when fields are hidden/shown.

## Version

- **Updated**: 2025-01-14
- **Script**: `/api/script/unified/[siteId]`
- **Applies to**: All sites using the unified script

## Technical Details

The fix uses HTML5 data attributes to track the original `required` state:

```javascript
// When hiding a field
if (targetField.hasAttribute('required')) {
  targetField.setAttribute('data-roolify-was-required', 'true');
  targetField.removeAttribute('required');
}

// When showing a field
if (targetField.getAttribute('data-roolify-was-required') === 'true') {
  targetField.setAttribute('required', '');
  targetField.removeAttribute('data-roolify-was-required');
}
```

This ensures:
- ✅ No conflicts with other scripts
- ✅ Original field state is preserved
- ✅ Works with dynamically added fields
- ✅ No performance impact
