# Activity Site Filtering Fix

## üö® Problem Identified
The **Recent Activity** section was showing activity from **other sites** instead of staying site-specific. This happened because:

1. **No site filtering**: When no site was selected or no forms were loaded, it showed **all activities** from all sites
2. **Race condition**: Activities were loaded before forms were filtered by site
3. **No re-filtering**: When switching sites, activities weren't re-filtered

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

### **1. Fixed Activity Filtering Logic**
```typescript
// BEFORE (showed all activities from all sites)
} else {
  // No site selected or no forms, show all activities (limited to 4)
  setActivities(allActivities.slice(0, 4));
}

// AFTER (shows no activities when no site/forms)
} else {
  // No site selected or no forms, show no activities (site-specific)
  console.log('[Dashboard] No site or forms, showing no activities');
  setActivities([]);
}
```

### **2. Added Site Change Detection**
```typescript
// Re-filter activities when site or forms change
useEffect(() => {
  if (selectedSiteId || siteId) {
    loadActivities();
  }
}, [selectedSiteId, siteId, forms.length]);
```

### **3. Enhanced Debugging**
```typescript
console.log('[Dashboard] Loading activities for site:', currentSiteId, 'with', forms.length, 'forms');
console.log('[Dashboard] Form IDs in current site:', Array.from(formIdsInSite));
console.log(`[Dashboard] Activity ${activity.id} (formId: ${activity.formId}) in site: ${isInSite}`);
```

## üéØ How It Works Now

### **Site-Specific Activity Filtering:**
1. **Get all activities** from the API
2. **Get form IDs** from the currently selected site
3. **Filter activities** to only show those with `formId` matching forms in the current site
4. **Show empty** if no site selected or no forms loaded

### **Automatic Re-filtering:**
- ‚úÖ **Site switching** - Activities re-filter when you change sites
- ‚úÖ **Form changes** - Activities re-filter when forms are added/removed
- ‚úÖ **Page load** - Activities filter correctly on initial load

## üìä Expected Results

### **Before Fix:**
- Recent Activity showed activity from **all sites**
- Switching sites didn't update activity
- "No activity yet" was rare

### **After Fix:**
- Recent Activity shows **only current site's activity**
- Switching sites immediately updates activity
- "No activity yet" shows when no activity for current site

## üîç Console Logs You'll See

```
[Dashboard] Loading activities for site: 68bc42f58e22a62ce5c282e0 with 2 forms
[Dashboard] Form IDs in current site: ['68e0a4f2b9f73a64398b8e4a', '68bc44e9bce2c534f83c8a07']
[Dashboard] Activity 1760180727485 (formId: 68e0a4f2b9f73a64398b8e4a) in site: true
[Dashboard] Activity 1760177689319 (formId: 6528ada2f72a91e09ec679e4) in site: false
[Dashboard] Filtered activities: 1 from 5 total
```

## üöÄ Benefits

1. **Site Isolation** - Each site only sees its own activity
2. **Real-time Updates** - Activity updates when switching sites
3. **Clean UI** - No more cross-site activity pollution
4. **Better UX** - Users see relevant activity for their selected site

**Refresh your browser now** - the Recent Activity should stay site-specific! üéâ
