2. **Install your app** from the Webflow Designer
3. **Authorize for that site**
4. **Check your dashboard** - you should see multiple sites!

## 🎯 What This Enables

- ✅ **Multiple site installation** - Works just like in the video
- ✅ **Public OAuth flow** - Webflow can redirect to your ngrok URL
