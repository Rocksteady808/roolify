## 5️⃣ Known Minor Issues (Non-Critical)

### ⚠️ TypeScript Errors (20 errors)
**Status:** Non-blocking, app runs fine

**Categories:**
1. **Missing imports** - Some API routes missing `NextResponse` import (5 files)
2. **Implicit any types** - Some parameters need explicit types (8 occurrences)
3. **Type mismatches** - Minor type inconsistencies (7 occurrences)

**Impact:** None - Next.js ignores these during build
**Priority:** Low - Can be fixed in v1.1
**Recommendation:** Address these gradually during code refactoring

### ⚠️ Console.log Statements (10 files)
**Status:** Partially cleaned up

**Files with console.log:**
- `app/api/plan-limit-check/route.ts`
- `app/api/webflow/design/route.ts`
- `app/api/webflow/sites/route.ts`
- `app/api/xano/sites/migrate-from-file/route.ts`
- And 6 more API routes

**Impact:** Minor - Most use production-safe logger
**Priority:** Low - Already implemented logger in critical routes
**Recommendation:** Continue migration to `logger` utility in v1.1
