## Key Differences: Free vs Paid

### Free Plan (Testing Tier)
- ✅ Perfect for testing on staging sites
- ✅ Try all features before buying
- ✅ No credit card required
- ✅ Never expires
- ❌ Only works on webflow.io domains
- ❌ Limited to 100 total submissions
- ❌ Cannot use on live/published custom domains

### Paid Plans (Production Tier)
- ✅ Works on all custom domains
- ✅ Monthly submission limits (resets each month)
- ✅ Professional support
- ✅ Advanced features (webhooks, API, etc.)
- ✅ Suitable for production use

## Implementation Notes

### Domain Restriction Enforcement

To fully implement the Free plan restriction, you'll need to add domain checking:

```typescript
// In form submission capture or rule execution
function canUseOnDomain(userPlan: string, siteUrl: string): boolean {
  if (userPlan === 'Free') {
    // Free plan only works on webflow.io staging domains
    return siteUrl.includes('webflow.io');
  }
  // Paid plans work on all domains
  return true;
}
```

This check should be implemented in:
1. Form submission webhook (reject submissions from custom domains on Free plan)
2. Script serving endpoint (conditionally serve script based on plan)
3. Rule execution (check domain before applying rules)

### User Onboarding Flow

**Recommended Flow:**
1. New user signs up → automatically assigned Free plan
2. User tests on staging site (webflow.io)
3. When ready for production (custom domain):
   - System detects custom domain
   - Shows upgrade prompt: "Custom domains require a paid plan"
   - User selects Starter/Pro/Agency plan
   - Enters payment info
   - Instantly activated on custom domain

### Messaging Strategy

**Free Plan Users:**
- "Test everything on your staging site"
- "Ready to go live? Upgrade to use on your custom domain"
- "No credit card required to start"

**Upgrade Prompts:**
- "Your site is published! Upgrade to enable Roolify on your custom domain"
- "Approaching 100 submissions? Upgrade for unlimited monthly submissions"
- "Need more forms? Upgrade to Starter for up to 5 forms"

## Benefits of This Model

### For Users:
1. **Risk-Free Testing**: Full feature access on staging sites
2. **No Pressure**: No time limit, no credit card needed
3. **Clear Value**: Can fully test before paying
4. **Natural Upgrade Path**: When publishing to custom domain

### For Business:
1. **Lower Barrier to Entry**: More sign-ups
2. **Natural Upgrade Trigger**: Publishing site = ready to pay
3. **Qualified Leads**: Users who upgrade have already tested and like the product
4. **Clear Value Prop**: "Works on staging free, pay for production"

## Migration Path

If you have existing users:
- Users with active trial → Keep on trial, convert to Free after trial ends
- Users with paid plans → No changes
- New users → Start on Free plan

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Plans page updated
2. ✅ Documentation updated
3. ⏳ Implement domain checking logic
4. ⏳ Add upgrade prompts in UI
5. ⏳ Update Xano with Free plan data
6. ⏳ Set new users to Free plan by default
7. ⏳ Add domain detection to script serving
8. ⏳ Add "Upgrade" call-to-action for Free plan users attempting custom domain use

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Free plan displays correctly on /plans page
- [ ] Price shows "Free Forever"
- [ ] Submissions show "100 total" (not "/mo")
- [ ] Button says "Get Started Free"
- [ ] FAQ explains webflow.io restriction
- [ ] Trust indicators updated (no trial mention)
- [ ] 4-column grid displays properly on all screen sizes
- [ ] Annual toggle doesn't affect Free plan price
- [ ] Domain restriction enforced in backend
- [ ] Upgrade prompt shown for custom domain users on Free plan

## Summary

The Free plan creates a risk-free way for users to test Roolify on their Webflow staging sites (webflow.io domains) before committing to a paid plan. This aligns with the natural Webflow workflow:

1. **Build on staging** (webflow.io) → Use Roolify Free
2. **Publish to custom domain** → Upgrade to paid plan

This model removes friction while creating a clear upgrade trigger when users are ready to go live with their site.
