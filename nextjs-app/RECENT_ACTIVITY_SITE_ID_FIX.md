# Recent Activity Site ID Fix

## 🚨 Root Problem Identified

The Recent Activity was showing the same activities for every site because **activities were not being logged with site information**:

### **Root Cause:**
- ❌ **Activities had no siteId** - activities were logged without site information
- ❌ **All activities showed everywhere** - no way to filter by site
- ❌ **Rule builder not passing siteId** - siteId was empty string in API calls
- ❌ **Activity API couldn't filter** - no siteId to filter by

## ✅ Complete Solution Implemented

### **1. Added siteId to Activity Type**

**Before:**
```typescript
export type Activity = {
  id: string;
  type: ActivityType;
  timestamp: string;
  ruleName: string;
  ruleId: string;
  formId: string;
  // No siteId!
};
```

**After:**
```typescript
export type Activity = {
  id: string;
  type: ActivityType;
  timestamp: string;
  ruleName: string;
  ruleId: string;
  formId: string;
  siteId?: string; // Add siteId to track which site the activity belongs to
};
```

### **2. Updated Rule Builder to Pass siteId**

**Before:**
```typescript
body: JSON.stringify({ 
  formId: rule.formId,
  // No siteId passed!
  logicType: rule.logicType,
  conditions, 
  actions,
  status 
})
```

**After:**
```typescript
body: JSON.stringify({ 
  formId: rule.formId,
  siteId: siteId, // Pass the siteId from the rule builder
  logicType: rule.logicType,
  conditions, 
  actions,
  status 
})
```

### **3. Updated Universal Script API to Use siteId**

**Before:**
```typescript
const { formId, conditions, actions, status, rules, userId = 1 } = body as any;
// ...
siteId: '', // Empty string!
```

**After:**
```typescript
const { formId, siteId, conditions, actions, status, rules, userId = 1 } = body as any;
// ...
siteId: siteId || '', // Use the siteId from the request
```

### **4. Updated RulesStore to Log siteId in Activities**

**Before:**
```typescript
logActivity({
  type: 'rule_created',
  ruleName: newRule.name,
  ruleId: newRule.id,
  formId: newRule.formId,
  // No siteId!
});
```

**After:**
```typescript
logActivity({
  type: 'rule_created',
  ruleName: newRule.name,
  ruleId: newRule.id,
  formId: newRule.formId,
  siteId: newRule.siteId, // Include siteId in activity
});
```

### **5. Updated Activity API to Filter by siteId**

**Before:**
```typescript
// For now, return all activities to see if the basic functionality works
activities = allActivities.slice(0, limit);
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Filter activities by siteId
activities = allActivities.filter(activity => 
  activity.siteId === siteId
).slice(0, limit);
```

## 📊 Before vs After

### **Before Fix:**

**Activity Logging:**
```
Activity: {
  id: "123",
  type: "rule_created",
  formId: "68e0a4f2b9f73a64398b8e4a",
  // No siteId!
}
```

**Activity API:**
```
Site A: Shows ALL activities (wrong!)
Site B: Shows ALL activities (wrong!)
Site C: Shows ALL activities (wrong!)
```

**User Experience:**
- ❌ **Same activities everywhere** - no site-specific filtering
- ❌ **Confusing** - users see other sites' activities
- ❌ **Wrong data** - activities from one site appear on others

### **After Fix:**

**Activity Logging:**
```
Activity: {
  id: "123",
  type: "rule_created",
  formId: "68e0a4f2b9f73a64398b8e4a",
  siteId: "68bc42f58e22a62ce5c282e0" // Now includes siteId!
}
```

**Activity API:**
```
Site A: Shows only Site A activities ✅
Site B: Shows only Site B activities ✅
Site C: Shows only Site C activities ✅
```

**User Experience:**
- ✅ **Site-specific activities** - each site shows only its activities
- ✅ **Clear separation** - no cross-site pollution
- ✅ **Correct data** - activities only appear on their site

## 🔧 Files Updated

### **1. Activity Store** (`lib/activityStore.ts`)
- ✅ **Added siteId to Activity type** - tracks which site activities belong to
- ✅ **Updated type definition** - includes optional siteId field

### **2. Rule Builder** (`app/rule-builder/page.tsx`)
- ✅ **Pass siteId in API calls** - includes siteId when creating rules
- ✅ **Site context preserved** - rule builder knows which site it's on

### **3. Universal Script API** (`app/api/universal-script/route.ts`)
- ✅ **Extract siteId from request** - gets siteId from request body
- ✅ **Pass siteId to saveRule** - includes siteId when saving rules

### **4. Rules Store** (`lib/rulesStore.ts`)
- ✅ **Log siteId in activities** - includes siteId when logging activities
- ✅ **All activity types updated** - rule_created, rule_updated, rule_deleted

### **5. Activity API** (`app/api/activity/route.ts`)
- ✅ **Filter by siteId** - only shows activities for the current site
- ✅ **Simple filtering logic** - clean and straightforward

## 🎯 Key Improvements

### **1. True Site Isolation**
- ✅ **Site-specific activities** - each site shows only its activities
- ✅ **No cross-site pollution** - activities don't leak between sites
- ✅ **Clear data separation** - each site has its own activity history
- ✅ **Proper filtering** - activities filtered by siteId

### **2. Complete Data Flow**
- ✅ **Rule builder → API → RulesStore → Activity** - siteId flows through entire chain
- ✅ **Consistent site tracking** - siteId preserved at every step
- ✅ **Proper activity logging** - activities include site context
- ✅ **Accurate filtering** - activities filtered by site

### **3. Better User Experience**
- ✅ **Site-specific results** - users see only their site's activities
- ✅ **No confusion** - clear separation between sites
- ✅ **Accurate data** - activities appear on correct sites
- ✅ **Predictable behavior** - consistent across all sites

## 🎉 Perfect Solution!

The Recent Activity section now:
- ✅ **Shows site-specific activities** - each site shows only its activities
- ✅ **No cross-site pollution** - activities don't leak between sites
- ✅ **Proper data flow** - siteId flows from rule creation to activity display
- ✅ **Clean separation** - each site has its own activity history

**Test it now:**
1. Create a rule on Site A
2. Check Recent Activity on Site A → **Shows the rule creation!** ✅
3. Check Recent Activity on Site B → **Shows empty (no activities)!** ✅
4. Create a rule on Site B
5. Check Recent Activity on Site B → **Shows the new rule creation!** ✅

**The key insight:** Activities need to be logged with site information from the very beginning. The siteId flows from the rule builder → API → RulesStore → Activity logging → Activity filtering. Now each site shows only its own activities! 🎉
