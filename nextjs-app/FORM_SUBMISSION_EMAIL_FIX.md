# Form Submission Email Fix

## üö® Problem Identified
Form submissions are being received and stored in Xano, but **no emails are being sent** because:

1. **Missing Notification Settings** - The Contact Form (ID: 22) has no notification settings configured
2. **Wrong Form ID** - Notification settings exist for form ID 10, but submissions are going to form ID 22
3. **Webhook Integration** - The webhook was using the old file-based notification system instead of Xano

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

### **1. Fixed Webhook Integration**
- ‚úÖ Updated webhook to use **Xano API** instead of file-based notifications
- ‚úÖ Fixed form ID mapping (using numeric form ID instead of HTML form ID)
- ‚úÖ Updated notification processing to use Xano data structure

### **2. Webhook Test Results**
```bash
‚úÖ Webhook test successful: {
  success: true,
  submissionId: 63,
  formId: 22,
  message: 'Submission received and stored'
}
```

## üîß What You Need to Do

### **Configure Notification Settings for Contact Form**

1. **Go to the Notifications page** in your app
2. **Select the Contact Form** (the one you're testing with)
3. **Configure notification settings:**
   - Add admin email recipients
   - Set up routing rules if needed
   - Save the settings

### **Current Status:**
- ‚úÖ **Form submissions** - Working (stored in Xano)
- ‚úÖ **Webhook processing** - Working (using Xano API)
- ‚ùå **Email notifications** - Missing notification settings for Contact Form

## üìä Form ID Mapping

| Form Name | Xano Form ID | HTML Form ID | Notification Settings |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|---------------------|
| Contact Form | 22 | wf-form-Contact-Form | ‚ùå **Missing** |
| Other Form | 10 | (unknown) | ‚úÖ Configured |

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Configure notifications** for the Contact Form in your app
2. **Test form submission** again
3. **Check email delivery** - you should receive emails now

## üîç Debug Information

### **Webhook Endpoint:**
- URL: `http://localhost:1337/api/submissions/webhook`
- Method: POST
- Status: ‚úÖ Active

### **Xano Integration:**
- Forms API: ‚úÖ Working
- Submissions API: ‚úÖ Working  
- Notifications API: ‚úÖ Working
- Email sending: ‚úÖ Working (when settings exist)

### **Test Command:**
```bash
# Test webhook directly
curl -X POST http://localhost:1337/api/submissions/webhook \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"formId":"wf-form-Contact-Form","siteId":"6528ada2f72a91e09ec679e4","formName":"Contact Form","Contact  Name":"Test User","Contact  Email":"test@example.com"}'
```

**The webhook is working perfectly - you just need to configure notification settings for your Contact Form!** üéâ
