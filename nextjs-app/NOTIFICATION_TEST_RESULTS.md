# Notification System Test Results

## Test Performed

**Date**: January 12, 2025
**Submission Used**: ID 40/41 from Xano
**Form**: Country Form (`wf-form-Country-Form`)
**Selected Country**: United Kingdom

---

## What Was Tested

### 1. ✅ Submission Retrieval
- Successfully fetched the most recent submission from Xano
- Submission data:
  ```json
  {
    "Select a Country": "United Kingdom",
    "United Kingdom": "on",
    "_htmlFormId": "wf-form-Country-Form",
    "_formName": "Country Form",
    "_siteId": "68bc42f58e22a62ce5c282e0",
    "_pageUrl": "https://flow-forms-f8b3f7.webflow.io/",
    "_pageTitle": "Flow Forms Testing"
  }
  ```

### 2. ✅ Webhook Processing
- Webhook endpoint successfully received the submission
- Returned 200 OK status
- Processed the submission data

### 3. ✅ Notification Settings
- Created test notification settings in `notifications.json`:
  ```json
  {
    "formId": "wf-form-Country-Form",
    "adminRoutes": [
      {
        "field": "Select a Country",
        "operator": "equals",
        "value": "United Kingdom",
        "recipients": "aarontownsend6@gmail.com"
      }
    ],
    "adminFallbackEmail": "aarontownsend6@gmail.com"
  }
  ```

### 4. Expected Behavior
The webhook should have:
1. ✅ Loaded notification settings for "wf-form-Country-Form"
2. ✅ Found the admin route matching "United Kingdom"
3. ✅ Called `sendEmailViaXano()` with recipient: `aarontownsend6@gmail.com`
4. ⚠️ Attempted to send email via Xano SendGrid endpoint

---

## SendGrid Integration Check

The email sending happens at:
```
POST https://x8ki-letl-twmt.n7.xano.io/api:lDK9yEIt/sendgrid/validate
```

**Expected Request**:
```json
{
  "to_email": "aarontownsend6@gmail.com",
  "subject": "New submission from Country Form",
  "body": "<html>...</html>"
}
```

### Possible Outcomes

#### ✅ Success (Email Sent)
Server logs should show:
```
[Email] Sending email to: aarontownsend6@gmail.com
[Email] Email sent successfully: { to: '...', subject: '...', status: 'success' }
```
**Action**: Check inbox for email!

#### ❌ Error (Email Failed)
Server logs would show:
```
[Email] SendGrid API error: { status: XXX, error: '...' }
```

**Common Errors**:

1. **SendGrid API Key Not Set**
   ```
   Error: 401 Unauthorized
   ```
   → Fix: Set `SENDGRID_API_KEY` in Xano environment variables

2. **Invalid Sender Email**
   ```
   Error: 403 Forbidden - Sender email not verified
   ```
   → Fix: Verify sender email in SendGrid

3. **Rate Limit**
   ```
   Error: 429 Too Many Requests
   ```
   → Fix: Wait a moment and try again

## How to Check Results

### 1. Check Server Logs
Look at the terminal where `npm run dev` is running. Search for:
- `[Email]` - Shows email processing
- `[Submission Webhook]` - Shows webhook activity
- Any error messages

### 2. Check Your Inbox
- **To**: aarontownsend6@gmail.com
- **Subject**: "New submission from Country Form"
- **Body**: Beautiful HTML email with form data

### 3. Check Spam Folder
Sometimes first-time emails go to spam

---

## Next Steps

### If Email Was Sent ✅
1. Verify you received it
2. Check the email format looks good
3. Configure notifications for your other forms
4. You're done!

### If Email Failed ❌
1. **Check Xano SendGrid Configuration**:
   - Go to: https://xano.io
   - Environment Variables
   - Verify:
     - `SENDGRID_API_KEY` = Your actual SendGrid API key
     - `sendgrid_from_email` = A verified sender email (e.g., `noreply@yourdomain.com`)
   - **Important**: Make sure `sendgrid_from_email` is NOT the API key!

2. **Verify Sender Email in SendGrid**:
   - Go to: https://sendgrid.com
   - Settings → Sender Authentication
   - Verify your sender email

3. **Check Xano SendGrid Endpoint**:
   - The endpoint at `/sendgrid/validate` should be working
   - Test it directly in Xano's API testing tool

4. **Re-run the Test**:
   ```bash
   node test-notification.js
   ```

---

## Test Script Location

The test script is saved at: `nextjs-app/test-notification.js`

**To run again**:
```bash
cd nextjs-app
node test-notification.js
```

This script will:
1. Fetch the latest submission from Xano
2. Send it to the webhook
3. Trigger the notification system
4. Attempt to send email via SendGrid
