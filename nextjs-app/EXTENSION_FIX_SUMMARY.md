# ✅ Designer Extension Fixed - Summary

## Problem
The app appeared extremely small when loaded in the Webflow Designer Extension.

## Solution
Created a dedicated `/extension` route optimized for the Designer panel with proper viewport configuration and responsive styling.

## What Was Done

### 1. Created Extension Route
- **File:** `app/extension/page.tsx`
- Simplified dashboard view
- Optimized for 800px width
- Quick actions and forms list

### 2. Added Iframe Detection
- **File:** `lib/iframeDetection.ts`
- Utility functions to detect iframe context
- Detect Webflow Designer specifically

### 3. Created Extension Layout
- **File:** `app/extension/layout.tsx`
- Proper viewport meta tag
- Optimized for iframe rendering

### 4. Updated Configuration
- **File:** `webflow.json`
- Added `homepage: "/extension"`
- Points Designer to optimized view

### 5. Added Responsive Styles
- **File:** `app/globals.css`
- Iframe-specific CSS
- Responsive breakpoints
- Proper scaling

### 6. Updated Main Layout
- **File:** `app/layout.tsx`
- Added viewport meta tag
- Ensures proper scaling

## Next Steps (YOU MUST DO)

### Step 1: Restart Dev Server
```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
cd nextjs-app
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Update Webflow Development URL
1. Open Webflow Designer
2. Go to Apps panel
3. Find "Form Flow" or "Roolify"
4. Update Development URL to: `http://localhost:1337/extension`
5. Click "Launch development App"

### Step 3: Test
- Extension should display at proper size
- Text should be readable
- Buttons should be clickable
- Forms list should show
