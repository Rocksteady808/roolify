## 🔴 Critical Issues (Block Submission)

**None found** - App meets all technical requirements for Webflow Marketplace submission.

---

## 🟡 High Priority UX Issues (Recommended Before Launch)

### 1. No Landing Page
**Issue:** Root URL (`/`) immediately redirects to `/dashboard`  
**Impact:** New users see login/auth screens before understanding what Roolify does  
**File:** `app/page.tsx` (line 6: `redirect("/dashboard")`)

**Current Behavior:**
```typescript
export default function Home() {
  redirect("/dashboard");
}
```

**Recommendation:** Create a marketing landing page that explains:
- What Roolify does
- Key features (conditional logic, smart notifications, submissions)
- Clear CTA buttons (Sign Up / Login / View Demo)
- Testimonials or example use cases

### 2. No Onboarding Flow
**Issue:** After signup, users are dropped directly into the dashboard with no guidance  
**Impact:** Users don't know what to do first, leading to confusion and abandonment

**Recommendation:**
- Add a welcome modal or tour after first login
- Highlight key steps: Connect Site → Create Rule → Install Script
- Add contextual tooltips for first-time actions
- Consider a progress checklist in the sidebar

### 3. Confusing First-Time Dashboard State
**Issue:** Empty dashboard for new users shows technical states like "No sites connected"  
**Impact:** Doesn't explain what sites are or why user needs one

**File:** `app/dashboard/page.tsx`

**Recommendation:**
- Better empty state messaging:
  - "Welcome to Roolify! Let's get started by connecting your first Webflow site"
  - Visual illustration or icon
  - Prominent "Connect Your First Site" button
  - Link to documentation

### 4. Complex Rule Builder for First-Time Users
**Issue:** Rule Builder assumes user understanding of conditions and actions  
**Impact:** Users may not understand how to create their first rule

**File:** `app/rule-builder/page.tsx`

**Recommendation:**
- Add example templates ("Show this field when...")
- Include helper text explaining conditions vs. actions
- Add a "Create Your First Rule" guided flow
- Show visual preview of how rules work

### 5. Missing Value Proposition
**Issue:** New users don't see benefits before signing up  
**Impact:** Lower conversion rates

**Recommendation:**
- Create landing page with benefits:
  - "Add conditional logic to forms without code"
  - "Smart email routing based on responses"
  - "Track all submissions in one place"
- Add use case examples (contact forms, lead qualification, multi-step forms)

## 🟢 Nice-to-Have Improvements

### 1. In-App Help System

- Quick tips on each page
- Keyboard shortcuts guide

### 2. Video Tutorials
- Record short videos showing:
  - How to create your first rule
  - How to install the Roolify script
  - How to set up notifications

### 3. Better Empty States
**Files to Improve:**
- `app/rule-builder/page.tsx` - Empty rules list
- `app/notifications/page.tsx` - No notifications configured
- `app/submissions/page.tsx` - No submissions yet

**Add:**
- Helpful imagery
- Clear next steps
- Links to documentation

### 4. Success Feedback
- Add toast notifications for actions:
  - "Rule saved successfully!"
  - "Site connected!"
  - "Notification settings updated!"

### 5. Mobile App Banner
- Consider adding app install banner for PWA
- Optimize for mobile usage in Webflow Designer
