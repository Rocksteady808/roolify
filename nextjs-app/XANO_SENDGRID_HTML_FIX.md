# Fix: SendGrid Sending Raw HTML Instead of Formatted Emails

## The Problem

Emails are being sent with raw HTML code visible instead of being rendered as formatted HTML. This happens when SendGrid receives the content as "plain text" instead of "HTML content".

---

## Solution: Update Xano SendGrid Endpoint

### Step 1: Go to Your Xano SendGrid Endpoint

1. Go to **Xano.io**
2. Navigate to your API group: **`lDK9yEIt`**
3. Find the endpoint: **`POST /sendgrid/validate`**
4. Click to edit it

---

### Step 2: Check the SendGrid Function Stack

Your endpoint should have a **SendGrid** function in the stack. This is where the issue is.

#### Current (Incorrect) Setup:
```
Inputs:
- to_email (text)
- subject (text)
- body (text)  ‚Üê This is being sent as PLAIN TEXT

SendGrid Function:
- Content: using "body" variable as plain text
```

#### What You Need:
```
Inputs:
- to_email (text)
- subject (text)
- html_body (text)  ‚Üê This will contain HTML

SendGrid Function:
- Content Type: HTML
- Content: using "html_body" variable
```

---

### Step 3: Update the SendGrid Function

**In the SendGrid function block:**

1. **Find the "Content" or "Body" field**

2. **There should be two content type options:**
   - **Plain Text** (currently selected)
   - **HTML** ‚Üê Select this one

3. **Update the variable reference:**
   - Change from: `{{body}}`
   - Change to: `{{html_body}}`

4. **The configuration should look like:**
   ```
   To: {{to_email}}
   Subject: {{subject}}
   Content Type: HTML
   HTML Content: {{html_body}}
   ```

---

### Step 4: Update Endpoint Inputs (if needed)

If your endpoint inputs don't include `html_body`:

1. **In the "Inputs" section**, add a new input:
   - Name: `html_body`
   - Type: `text`
   - Required: `Yes`

2. **Keep the old `body` input** for backwards compatibility (optional)

---

### Step 5: Save and Test

1. Click **"Save"** in the top right
2. Run the test again to trigger a new email

---

## Alternative: Simple Quick Fix

If you can't find the HTML option, you can try this simpler approach:

### In Your SendGrid Function:

**Look for these common configurations:**

**Option A - Content Type Dropdown:**
```
Content Type: [Dropdown]
- Text/Plain  ‚Üê currently selected
- Text/HTML   ‚Üê select this
```

**Option B - Two Separate Fields:**
```
Text Content: [leave empty]
HTML Content: {{html_body}}  ‚Üê use this one
```

**Option C - SendGrid API Direct:**
If you're using SendGrid's API directly, make sure you're using:
```json
{
  "personalizations": [{ "to": [{ "email": "..." }] }],
  "from": { "email": "..." },
  "subject": "...",
  "content": [{
    "type": "text/html",    ‚Üê Must be "text/html" not "text/plain"
    "value": "{{html_body}}"
  }]
}
```

## After Updating

Once you've updated the Xano endpoint:

### Test the Fix:

```bash
cd nextjs-app
node test-notification.js
```

**You should receive a beautifully formatted email** with:
- ‚ú® Purple gradient header
- üìä Clean table layout
- üé® Proper styling and colors
- No visible HTML code

---

## If Still Not Working

### Check These:

1. **Verify SendGrid API Key** is set in Xano Environment Variables
2. **Verify sender email** is verified in SendGrid
3. **Check Xano function logs** for any errors
4. **Test the Xano endpoint directly** using Xano's test feature with this payload:
   ```json
   {
     "to_email": "your@email.com",
     "subject": "Test HTML Email",
     "html_body": "<h1>Hello World</h1><p>This should be <strong>formatted</strong>!</p>"
   }
   ```

---

## Summary

**The issue:** SendGrid is sending emails as plain text
**The fix:** Configure the SendGrid function in Xano to use HTML content type
**Expected result:** Beautiful formatted emails instead of raw HTML code

Let me know once you've updated it and we'll test again!
