# Draft Page Filtering - FIXED ✅

## Issue
Forms on **draft/unpublished pages** were still showing up in the app.

## Root Cause
The filtering logic was only checking for **archived** pages (`!page.archived`), but NOT checking for **draft** pages (`page.isDraft`).

## What Was Fixed

### Before (Bug):
```typescript
if (!page.archived) {
  publishedPageIds.add(page.id);  // ❌ Only excluded archived pages
}
```

### After (Fixed):
```typescript
if (!page.archived && !page.isDraft) {
  publishedPageIds.add(page.id);  // ✅ Excludes BOTH archived AND draft pages
}
```

## Files Updated

✅ **1. Dashboard** (`app/dashboard/page.tsx` line 288)
- Fixed page filtering to exclude draft pages

✅ **2. Rule Builder** (`app/rule-builder/page.tsx` lines 241, 325)
- Fixed both instances of page filtering

✅ **3. Notifications** (`app/notifications/page.tsx` lines 680, 838)
- Fixed both instances of page filtering

✅ **4. Submissions** (`app/submissions/page.tsx` line 176)
- Fixed page filtering

✅ **5. Forms API** (`app/api/forms/with-real-options/route.ts` line 66)
- Fixed server-side filtering

✅ **6. Site Scanner API** (`app/api/scan/site-scanner/route.ts` line 127)
- Fixed site scanning to exclude draft pages

## Page States (Webflow API)

| State | `archived` | `isDraft` | Show in App? |
|-------|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| **Published & Live** | `false` | `false` | ✅ **YES** |
| **Draft (unpublished)** | `false` | `true` | ❌ **NO** |
| **Archived** | `true` | `false` | ❌ **NO** |

## What Will Be Filtered Out Now

### ❌ **Will NOT Show:**
1. Forms on **draft pages** (`isDraft: true`)
2. Forms on **archived pages** (`archived: true`)
3. Forms in **"Utility Pages" folder** (existing filter)

### ✅ **Will Show:**
1. Forms on **published pages** (`isDraft: false, archived: false`)
2. Forms **NOT in Utility Pages folder**

## Testing Checklist

After refreshing the app, verify:

- [ ] ✅ Form on a **published page** → Should show
- [ ] ❌ Form on a **draft page** → Should NOT show
- [ ] ❌ Form on an **archived page** → Should NOT show
- [ ] ❌ Unpublish a page in Webflow → Form should disappear
- [ ] ✅ Publish a draft page in Webflow → Form should appear

## Console Logs

You should now see different filtering behavior:

### Before Fix:
```
[Dashboard] 📄 Published page IDs: ['page-1', 'page-2', 'draft-page-3']  // ❌ Draft included
[Dashboard] ✅ KEEPING: "Form on Draft Page"  // ❌ Bug
```

### After Fix:
```
[Dashboard] 📄 Published page IDs: ['page-1', 'page-2']  // ✅ No draft
[Dashboard] ❌ FILTERED: Unpublished/archived page - "Form on Draft Page"  // ✅ Filtered
```

## Important Notes

1. **Refresh Required**: After publishing/unpublishing pages in Webflow, you need to **refresh the Roolify dashboard** to see changes.

2. **Cache Busting**: The app uses aggressive cache-busting to ensure fresh data, but browser caching might still affect results. Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R / Ctrl+Shift+F5) if needed.

3. **Webflow Publish Delay**: After publishing in Webflow, it may take a few seconds for the API to reflect the change.

## Summary

✅ **6 files updated** with draft page filtering  
✅ **Both client-side and server-side** filtering fixed  
✅ **Comprehensive coverage** across all pages and API routes  
✅ **Draft pages are now properly excluded** from the app  

Your forms on draft pages should now be hidden! 🎉
